         <p>I LOVE boxing! Huge fan of the culture and techique. Do I want to become a professional? Well....... maybe, i've been boxing since I was 16 and loved it since. I've also had previous experience with training for marathons and obstacle courses! </p>
         
         <h3>My Goal</h3>

         <p>My goal is to finish the CodeFellows, and gain a remote job or a job that's located in Austin Texas. From there, travel across the country then globe!</p>
